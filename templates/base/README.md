Template base
=============

This is the base template you can use as a starting point for your new script. It offers you some basic functionalities off the shelf that are easy to understand and modify according your personal preferences.



Requirements
------------

Please read the overall `README.md` file to understand the structure principles of this template. 



Installation
------------

- Install the code following the steps indicated in the overall `README.md` file, just remember to use all the contents of this directory as you working code.



Extend the template
-------------------

Although the template works from scratch, it does not much without your code and modifications. 






- You might want to rename the `template.py` file for something more suitable for you, like `process.py` or `core.py`
- You might want to rename the `your_code.py` file for something more related to the functionality your code aims to provide, like `custom_clustering.py` or `calculate_csv.py`



Running the code
---------------- 

**NOTE**: remember that you have to access your created virtual environment before running the code! To do so, navigate to the directory you created and activate it.
 - Example:
   - `cd /home/lab/sandbox/example`
   - `source bin/activate`

Once you have activated your virtual environment, just run the code with `python template.py` [or the name you have changed template.py with]
